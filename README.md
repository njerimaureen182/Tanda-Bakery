# Tanda-Bakery
A concept for a bakery website. Made with the Bootstrap framework.

# What I learnt
1. Use of flexbox to align content and make the website mobile-first.
2. Use of the animate on scroll library to create animations on the website.
3. Use of the "order" class to arrange content to a user's liking.
